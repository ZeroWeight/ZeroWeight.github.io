\section{Research Interest}

My research is centered on machine learning, with particular interests in reinforcement learning. My research goal is to develop and understand the foundation of decision-making processes for complicated tasks such as LLM, agentic systems, and structural design. I am also interested in developing AI agents for scientific (chemistry, physics) tasks
